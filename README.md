# ledble-ledlamp

Another set of extremely low priced LEDs.  These ones cost me Â£1.60 plus tax for a 5M strip with an IR remote and Bluetooth control.  The price has since increased.  I got them in the Anniversary Sale.

This Home Assistant integration supports LEDBLE lights which use the `LED Lamp` app over Bluetooth LE.  My device advertises the name `LEDBLE-01-9201`.  I only have one device that uses this controller at the moment, so I don't know if this changes (specifically the last four digits) but I don't expect it will. i.e. this name is probably fixed.

They provide write characteristic `0xFFE1`.

There is an interesting problem with these lights in that the name they advertise matches another set of lights with a different controller.  The default LED BLE Home Assistant integration tries to connect to these lights but doesn't speak the right protocol and doesn't try to connect to the right characteristic resulting in a blanket error.  A better fix would be to update the Home Assistant core integration to support these lights, but that would involve adding support to three other projects first, and it's a real spaghetti of indirection, so I can't be bothered.  There is an issue open [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/105338#issuecomment-2010342769) but I doubt anything will happen with it.
So this integration exists.  I don't yet know how they will co-exist.  We will soon find out.

## Bluetooth LE Protocol

The protocol for these lights is pretty easy to understand.  All packets type the format of:

## Installation

### Requirements

You need to have the bluetooth component configured and working in Home Assistant in order to use this integration.

### HACS

Add this repo to HACS as a custom repo.  Click through:

- HACS -> Integrations -> Top right menu -> Custom Repositories
- Paste the Github URL to this repo in to the Repository box
- Choose category `Integration`
- Click Add
- Restart Home Assistant

NB: Because of the advertised name of these devices the core `BLE LED` integration will try and control them, but it doesn't speak the correct protocol.  As such you have to manually add your devices.  Do this by:

- In the Integrations screen of Home Assistant click `Add Integration` in the bottom right
- Search for `LEDBLE Led Lamp` and click on it
- If any devices are in range of your HA server (or BT proxy) they will appear and allow you to add them
